            <h3>Who Built This?</h3>

                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Rahul Dinesh, a student at UNC Charlotte. I created this website as part of my web development course to make learning Python easier for others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My client and friend, Tim Burns, provided the idea and support for building this site. Together, we shaped CodeStarter to be beginner-friendly, straightforward, and fun to use.
